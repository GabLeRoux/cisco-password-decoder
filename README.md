# Cisco VPN Client Password Decoder

Pure javascript decoder for password encoding of Cisco VPN client.

Usually, you need to decrypt group password stored in *.PCF files to setup [native Cisco VPN connection in Mac OS X][1]. 

In contrast to other implementations, this decoder does everything in a browser, so a password never leaves your computer.
